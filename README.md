#### Step 3: Install Project Dependencies
The project uses dependencies for Firebase, Material Design, and AndroidX libraries. Android Studio should automatically download these dependencies from the build.gradle files, but you may need to manually sync them.
1. **Verify dependencies:**
   - Open the build.gradle files in the project:
       - **Project-level** build.gradle: This file manages global settings and dependencies shared across all modules.
       - **App-level** build.gradle: This file manages dependencies specific to the app module.
   - In the app-level build.gradle file, ensure the required dependencies are listed as shown below:
<pre>  dependencies 
{
    implementation(libs.androidx.core.ktx)
    implementation(libs.androidx.appcompat)
    implementation(libs.material)
    implementation(libs.androidx.activity)
    implementation(libs.androidx.constraintlayout)
    implementation(libs.firebase.auth)
    implementation(libs.firebase.database)
    implementation(libs.androidx.recyclerview)
    implementation(libs.firebase.firestore.ktx)
    implementation(libs.androidx.lifecycle.livedata.testing)

    // JUnit 4 for unit tests
    testImplementation("junit:junit:4.13.2")

    // Robolectric for Android unit testing
    testImplementation("org.robolectric:robolectric:4.9.1")
    testImplementation(libs.junit.jupiter)
    testImplementation(libs.testng)
    testImplementation(libs.junit.jupiter)
    testImplementation(libs.junit.jupiter)
    // Check for the latest version

    // Android test dependencies
    androidTestImplementation(libs.androidx.junit)
    androidTestImplementation(libs.androidx.espresso.core)

    // Dokka
    implementation("org.jetbrains.dokka:dokka-core:1.7.10")
    // JUnit 5
    testImplementation("org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-api:5.10.0")
    testRuntimeOnly("org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-engine:5.10.0")

    // Optional: AssertJ for fluent assertions (optional but helpful)
    testImplementation("org.assertj:assertj-core:3.24.2")

    // Android Testing libraries
    // To test LiveData and ViewModel
    testImplementation("androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-viewmodel-ktx:2.8.7")
    implementation("androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-livedata-testing:2.6.1")
    testImplementation("io.mockk:mockk:1.12.3") // For mocking in tests (mockk instead of Mockito)

    // Optionally, add JUnit Platform for running tests
    testRuntimeOnly("org.junit.platform:junit-platform-launcher:1.10.0")

    // For testing LiveData objects and ViewModel
    testImplementation("androidx.arch.core:core-testing:2.2.0")
    // Test for Kotlin coroutines (if your ViewModel uses coroutines)
    testImplementation("org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-test:1.7.3")

    implementation("org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib:1.9.24")
    implementation(kotlin("script-runtime"))
}  </pre>
2. **Sync dependencies:**
   - After verifying dependencies, click **Sync Now** if prompted at the top of the build.gradle file. This will download and install all necessary libraries and packages for the project.
   - If no prompt appears, manually initiate a sync by selecting **File > Sync Project with Gradle Files.**
3. **Check gradle configurations:**
   - Open the app-level build.gradle file and ensure the following SDK configurations are set, especially if Firebase Auth is being used:
      - minSdkVersion 23
      - targetSdkVersion \<latest SDK version\>
   - Confirm compatibility:
      - Ensure that both minSdkVersion and targetSdkVersion are compatible with the Firebase libraries used in the project. Adjust as necessary to avoid compatibility issues with Firebase and other libraries.
